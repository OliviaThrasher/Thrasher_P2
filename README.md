I used Visual Studio 2022. I had a problem with the message box, it kept popping up when the text box was blank, it even happened when I pressed the Clear button. I found the anwser on StackOverflow, it turns out I needed to make a clause that makes it fine for white spaces to be in the text box. So, it works fine now.
